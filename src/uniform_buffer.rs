//! # Uniform Buffer
//!
//! This module defines the `UniformBuffer` struct, which is used for transferring transformation
//! data, specifically a Model-View-Projection (MVP) matrix, between the CPU and the GPU. This matrix
//! is essential in rendering pipelines to manage the transformation of objects in 3D space to 2D
//! screen space.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Model-View-Projection (MVP) matrix integrates three key transformations required for rendering 3D objects:
//!
//! - **Model Transformation**: Adjusts the position, rotation, and scale of an object in world space.
//! - **View Transformation**: Represents the position and orientation of the camera to determine how
//!   the scene is viewed.
//! - **Projection Transformation**: Maps the 3D coordinates of the scene to a 2D space on the screen.
//!
//! The MVP matrix combines these transformations and is used in the GPU's vertex shader to correctly
//! position and render objects according to the camera perspective and 3D scene structure.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The `UniformBuffer` struct contains a single field:
//!
//! - `mvp`: A 4x4 matrix (`nalgebra_glm::Mat4`) used to store the combined MVP transformation.
//!
//! This struct is designed specifically for transferring data to the GPU via a uniform buffer. Its memory layout
//! is optimized to meet GPU alignment requirements.
//!
//! ### Memory Layout and Traits
//!
//! The `UniformBuffer` struct adheres to the following principles for efficient GPU compatibility:
//!
//! - `#[repr(C)]`: Ensures the struct uses a C-compatible memory layout that matches the GPU's expectations.
//! - `bytemuck::Pod` and `bytemuck::Zeroable`: Allow for safe and efficient conversion of the struct to raw bytes
//!   without introducing undefined behavior.
//!
//! These properties make it straightforward to upload `UniformBuffer` data into a GPU buffer via graphics APIs
//! such as [`wgpu`](https://wgpu.rs).
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The `UniformBuffer` can be used to send transformation data to a GPU for rendering. Below is an example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use nalgebra_glm as glm;
//! use wgpu::util::DeviceExt;
//!
//! // Initialize an MVP matrix as an identity matrix
//! let uniform_instance = UniformBuffer {
//!     mvp: glm::identity(), // No transformations applied initially
//! };
//!
//! // Convert the struct into raw bytes for uploading to the GPU
//! let raw_data = bytemuck::bytes_of(&uniform_instance);
//!
//! // Create a GPU buffer with the `wgpu` library
//! let device: wgpu::Device = /* Initialize your wgpu Device */;
//! let uniform_buffer = device.create_buffer_init(&wgpu::util::BufferInitDescriptor {
//!     label: Some("Uniform Buffer"),
//!     contents: raw_data,
//!     usage: wgpu::BufferUsages::UNIFORM | wgpu::BufferUsages::COPY_DST,
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! ## Performance Considerations
//!
//! - **Buffer Updates**: Each time an object's position, the camera view, or the projection settings change, the MVP matrix
//!   must be updated and re-uploaded to the GPU. For real-time rendering, minimize buffer updates to optimize performance.
//! - **Matrix Calculations**: Use libraries like [nalgebra-glm](https://docs.rs/nalgebra-glm) to calculate and combine
//!   the transformations efficiently.
//!
//! ## Struct Definition
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[repr(C)]
//! #[derive(Default, Debug, Copy, Clone, bytemuck::Pod, bytemuck::Zeroable)]
//! pub struct UniformBuffer {
//!     /// A 4x4 matrix representing the combined Model-View-Projection (MVP) transformations.
//!     ///
//!     /// - **Model Transformation**: Positions, scales, and rotates objects in the world.
//!     /// - **View Transformation**: Controls how the scene is observed from the camera's perspective.
//!     /// - **Projection Transformation**: Maps the 3D space to the 2D screen space.
//!     ///
//!     /// The MVP matrix is uploaded to GPU memory and used during rendering to position objects
//!     /// in screen space relative to the camera and scene settings.
//!     pub mvp: nalgebra_glm::Mat4,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Notes
//!
//! 1. Ensure alignment when transferring data to GPU buffers to avoid rendering artifacts or errors.
//! 2. Use double-buffering techniques or similar strategies to minimize performance bottlenecks caused by frequent uniform updates.
//! 3. The `UniformBuffer` struct is designed to seamlessly integrate with modern GPU APIs like `wgpu`.
//!
//! ## Summary
//!
//! The `UniformBuffer` provides a simple and efficient way to pass the MVP matrix from the CPU to the GPU. By adhering
//! to GPU memory layout requirements and leveraging libraries like `nalgebra-glm` for matrix calculations, it ensures
//! optimal performance and compatibility in 3D rendering pipelines.
